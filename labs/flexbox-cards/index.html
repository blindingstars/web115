          <h3>Adoption Day</h3>
          <p>Introducing&hellip; Nori and Dashi! Here they are on their adoption day, July 9, moments after first meeting them. Nori's the affectionate girl to the left and drew me in right away.</p>

          <h3>When I Knew</h3>
          <p>The girls arrived at the shelter the day before with their two brothers. I had a hard time deciding on the second cat I'd take home, but Dashi was so cuddly that she stole my heart.</p>

          <h3>Fearless Nori</h3>
          <p>Nori is the smaller cat, but don't let that fool you. She is brave, curious, and has a monstrous appetite.</p>

          <h3>Sweet Dashi</h3>
          <p>Dashi is more timid than Nori. Once she warms up to you, though, she is extremely sweet and loves to take naps on or against her favorite people.</p>

      <p>Nori and Dashi are two grey tabbies hailing from Alabama. They were transported to <a href="https://orphansofthestorm.org/">Orphans of the Storm</a> in Libertyville, IL and I adopted them the day after they arrived!</p>
